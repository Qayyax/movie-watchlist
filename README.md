# movie-watchlist
A solo project that test my knowledge on API and Local storage

[Deployed site](https://movie-watchlist-ap.netlify.app/)
***

## What this project is about

This project involves making fetch request to the OMDB movies api, which returns data about movies queried with the API. 

Two fetch request was made in this project, the first was to get data on the titles queied, the second request was to get the full data on the oveis based on the title returned from the first request. 

The project also involves having a watchlist page, which consists of the movies added to the watchlist (which would be stored in local storage)

## What I learnt from this project

- More on how to make fetch request
- I learnt about JavaScript Promise
- I learnt about Async and Await functions
- I also learnt how to make and use local storage as well
- Callback functions (I used this a lot)

## What I plan to improve

- Make a module to export functions which would be used in multiple scripts rather than duplicate the functions on each script
